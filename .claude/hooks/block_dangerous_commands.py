"""
PreToolUse hook: block obviously dangerous shell commands and any attempt to
read/print secret files.

Hook contract (Claude Code):
- Reads a JSON event from stdin.
- Looks at the tool name and its `command` argument when the tool is Bash / PowerShell / shell-like.
- Exits 2 to BLOCK the call. The message printed on stderr is shown back to the assistant.
- Exits 0 to allow the call.

This script is intentionally conservative. It is meant to catch obvious mistakes,
not to be a security boundary. The real security boundary is the human reviewer.
