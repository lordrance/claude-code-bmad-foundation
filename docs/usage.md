# Using This Template

This template is the **base layer** for new Claude Code projects. It is **not** an application. After deriving a project from it, you choose the stack inside that project and let BMAD-METHOD drive the development loop.

## 1. What this template gives you

| Layer | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) | Karpathy-style 60-line behavioral baseline + one beginner sentence. Loaded by Claude Code on every session. |
| `.gitignore` / `.gitattributes` / `.editorconfig` / `LICENSE` | Basic hygiene. Cross-OS line endings, common ignore patterns, MIT license. |
| `.claude/hooks/block_dangerous_commands.py` | Blocks Claude from running `rm -rf`, force-pushing, reading `.env` / private keys, printing secret env vars. |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Registers the hook above and pre-approves ~80 read-mostly / build / test commands. |
| `.mcp.json` | Pre-wires the [**Context7**](https://github.com/upstash/context7) MCP server. Claude can fetch live, version-specific docs for hundreds of libraries (React, Next.js, FastAPI, Django, …) instead of hallucinating old APIs. Free tier needs no key; just works on first session. |
| `.github/` | PR + Issue templates (`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`) so contributions follow a structure. Language-agnostic. |
| `package.json` + `playwright.config.ts` + `e2e/` | **Playwright pre-staged** for frontend end-to-end tests. Run `pnpm install && pnpm e2e:install` to activate (one Chromium download). The placeholder spec is `test.skip`'d, so `pnpm e2e` passes on an empty template. If your project is backend-only / CLI-only, delete these three files. |
| **BMAD-METHOD** (installed at template-init time) | Provides the PM / Architect / Developer / QA / UX agents and the SDLC workflow that takes a feature from idea → PRD → architecture → stories → code → QA. |
| `docs/` (this folder) | The two documents you are reading right now. |

That's it. No business code. No CI/CD pipelines. No security workflows. No Tier 1.5 policies. By design.

## 2. How to start a new project from this template

### Step 1 — Create the new repo from the template

On GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com/lordrance/claude-code-bmad-foundation
2. Click the green **Use this template** → **Create a new repository**
3. Give it a real name (e.g. `my-game-pilot`)
4. **Public or Private** — your call per project
5. **Include all branches**: unchecked (`main` is enough)

If you prefer the terminal:

```bash
gh repo create lordrance/<your-new-project> \
  --template lordrance/claude-code-bmad-foundation \
  --public \
  --clone
cd <your-new-project>
```

### Step 2 — Clone and verify the hook is registered

```bash
cd <your-new-project>
python -m py_compile .claude/hooks/block_dangerous_commands.py   # should be silent
python -m json.tool .claude/settings.json                         # should print the JSON
```

If both succeed, the safety hook is live.

### Step 3 — Update README and LICENSE for the new project

The template ships with a README that describes the template itself. Replace it with one that describes your new project. Update the LICENSE copyright holder if needed.

### Step 4 — Configure GitHub settings for the new repo

`Use this template` copies the **files**, but it does **not** carry over these per-repo settings — you have to set them once in the new repo:

| What to set | Why it doesn't carry over | Where in GitHub UI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description + topics** | GitHub policy; metadata is per-repo. | About panel (right side of repo main page) → ⚙ |
| **Branch protection on `main`** (optional for solo, recommended once collaborators join) | Not template-copied. | Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset |
| **Secret scanning + Push protection** | Defaults to ON for public repos; verify it is ON if you go private. | Settings → Code security |
| **Dependabot alerts + security updates** | Defaults vary; turn on explicitly. | Settings → Code security |
| **Merge prefs** (squash + rebase, no merge commit, delete branch on merge) | Not template-copied. | Settings → General → Pull Requests |
| **Disable Wiki / Projects** if you do not use them | Defaults to ON. | Settings → General → Features |

For a solo / personal project, you can skip branch protection. For anything you intend to share or take to production, enable at minimum:

- Require a pull request before merging
- Require status checks (after CI is added)
- Block force pushes
- Block deletions

These are the same defaults the **heavyweight sibling repo** (`claude-code-industrial-workbench`) configures automatically — when your project crosses that line, that template is the right move (see [`./decision-bmad-vs-full-workbench.md`](./decision-bmad-vs-full-workbench.md)).

### Step 5 — Now choose a stack — but **inside the new project, not back in the template**

Once you know what you're building (a web app, a CLI tool, a game backend…), add the stack-specific files inside the new project:

- Node project: add `package.json`, pick package manager
- Python project: add `pyproject.toml` + `uv` or `poetry` lockfile
- Go project: `go mod init`
- Etc.

**[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is pre-installed** for end-to-end browser tests. Unit tests (Vitest / Jest / Testing Library) cover component logic but can't test real browser navigation, route guards, route loaders, or cross-page flows — that's Playwright's job. Activate it once per derived project:

```bash
pnpm install              # installs @playwright/test
pnpm e2e:install          # downloads Chromium (~50 MB, one-time)
pnpm e2e                  # runs the (skipped) example spec — should pass clean
```

Once your app runs on `http://localhost:5173` (or change the `baseURL` in `playwright.config.ts`), unskip the example in `e2e/example.spec.ts` and write more specs alongside it. The BMAD `bmad-qa-generate-e2e-tests` skill generates Playwright specs against this layout.

**Backend-only / CLI-only project?** Delete `package.json`, `playwright.config.ts`, and `e2e/` — they're staged for the common case, not mandatory.

The template intentionally does not pick this for you. Different projects need different stacks.

## 3. How to drive BMAD's PM → Architect → Dev → QA loop

BMAD is the workflow engine. Once installed, it provides specialized agents that take your idea through a structured pipeline. Open Claude Code in the new project's folder and:

### 3.1 — Talk to the PM agent first (NEVER skip this)

```
@pm I want to build <one-sentence description of the project>.
Help me write the PRD.
```

The PM agent will ask clarifying questions (target users, success criteria, scope boundaries). Answer them honestly. The output is a **Product Requirements Document** in `docs/prd.md` (or whichever folder BMAD chose).

### 3.2 — Hand the PRD to the Architect agent

```
@architect Read docs/prd.md and propose an architecture.
```

The Architect agent will produce `docs/architecture.md` covering:
- Tech stack recommendation (this is where the stack choice actually gets made)
- Component boundaries
- Data model sketches
- Major trade-offs and risks

Push back on anything that doesn't fit your context (e.g. "I don't want Postgres for a single-user CLI"). Architecture is iterative.

### 3.3 — Break architecture into stories

```
@scrum-master Break the architecture into developer-ready stories.
```

The result is a set of files under `docs/stories/` (or BMAD's chosen path). Each story is a small, mergeable unit of work with acceptance criteria.

### 3.4 — Let the Developer agent implement one story at a time

```
@dev Implement story 1.1.
```

Critical rule: **one story per session**. Don't tell the Dev agent to "implement everything." That defeats the loop.

### 3.5 — QA verifies each story before the next

```
@qa Verify story 1.1.
```

QA writes tests, checks acceptance criteria, and either approves the story or sends it back to dev. Only after QA approves do you move on to story 1.2.

### 3.6 — Commit each completed story as its own commit

Use Conventional Commits:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(story-1.1): implement <thing>"
```

This is the cycle. PRD → architecture → stories → dev → QA → commit → next story. Slower than vibe-coding, dramatically higher hit rate on the first try.

## 4. Auto-pilot mode: low-friction execution

The default settings in this template are configured to **minimize confirmation clicks** without losing the safety floor. Three things make this work:

### 4.1 — `defaultMode: "acceptEdits"`

Set in [`.claude/settings.json`](../.claude/settings.json). File edits (Edit / Write / NotebookEdit) are auto-approved. You can still toggle modes mid-session with **Shift+Tab**:

| Mode | Behavior | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | Every Bash / PowerShell call asks | Touching anything sensitive |
| **`acceptEdits`** (this template's default) | File edits auto, shell asks unless on allowlist | Everyday coding |
| `bypassPermissions` | Everything auto except what the hook blocks | Strong autonomous runs; trust the hook completely |

### 4.2 — Pre-approved command allowlist

[`.claude/settings.json → permissions.allow`](../.claude/settings.json) pre-approves ~80 read-mostly and build/test/format/git-local commands. Categories:

- **Read-only filesystem**: `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `find`, `grep`, `wc`, `tree`, …
- **Git inspection + local-safe**: `git status / diff / log / show / branch / add / commit / fetch / checkout / restore / stash / tag`
- **Node ecosystem**: `npm test / lint / typecheck / build / dev`, `pnpm` equivalents, `npx prettier / eslint / tsc / vitest / jest / playwright`
- **Python ecosystem**: `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `uv run / sync / lock`
- **Go ecosystem**: `go test / build / vet`, `gofmt`, `golangci-lint`
- **Rust ecosystem**: `cargo build / test / check / clippy / fmt`
- **BMAD scripts**: `python _bmad/scripts/*`, `npx bmad-method *`
- **gh CLI read-only**: `gh repo view / pr view / pr list / run view / api repos/*`
- **PowerShell read-only**: `Get-*`, `Test-Path`, `ConvertFrom-Json`, etc.

Plus a **deny list** that overrides allow for the truly destructive: `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `git branch -D`, `gh repo delete`, `npm publish`, …

### 4.3 — Safety floor never disappears

[`.claude/hooks/block_dangerous_commands.py`](../.claude/hooks/block_dangerous_commands.py) runs on **every** Bash / PowerShell call, regardless of allowlist or mode. It blocks:

- `rm -rf` and equivalents
- `git push --force` (in any form)
- `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `git branch -D`
- Reading `.env` / `.env.*` / `*.pem` / `*.key`
- Printing `$SECRET` / `$TOKEN` / `$API_KEY` / `$GITHUB_TOKEN` style env vars

So even in `bypassPermissions` mode, these can't slip through.

### 4.4 — `/loop` slash command: one-shot Dev ↔ Review cycle

Defined in [`.claude/commands/loop.md`](../.claude/commands/loop.md). Invoke from any Claude Code session:

```
/loop story-1.1
```

(or `/loop "make the login form accept passkeys"` for an ad-hoc task)

What `/loop` does in **one continuous response** without stopping for your input:

1. **Dev** phase — uses the `bmad-dev-story` skill to implement
2. **Review** phase — uses the `bmad-code-review` skill to strictly inspect
3. **Apply** phase — uses `bmad-correct-course` to fix what review found
4. Loop back to step 2 until review finds 0 issues OR 3 cycles elapse
5. Produce **one** final report at the end

You read one summary at the end instead of typing `@qa`, `@dev`, `@qa`, `@dev`. If a decision genuinely needs your judgment (e.g. "should this be a public API?"), `/loop` collects all such questions at the end of the report so you answer them **all at once**, not interleaved with code changes.

### 4.5 — When to back off from auto-pilot

Switch back to `default` mode (Shift+Tab) when you are about to:

- Touch authentication / authorization code
- Write database migrations on tables with real data
- Modify payment / billing logic
- Edit production-touching infra-as-code
- Make irreversible API contract changes

The hook still wouldn't let you nuke files, but a sensitive logic change benefits from per-step pause to think.

### 4.6 — Trade-off, stated honestly

Less clicking = less per-step inspection. The hook catches **destructive** ops; it does **not** catch **wrong** ones. A `/loop` run that converges to "QA found 0 issues" can still produce code that satisfies the wrong requirement. **Read the final report.** If it touched files you didn't expect, that's the signal to roll back.

For the first BMAD cycle on any new project, prefer **default** mode until you trust the agent's judgment in your specific stack and domain. Then graduate to `acceptEdits` (default after derive) and eventually `bypassPermissions` for routine cycles.

## 5. Graduation tools — what to add later, NOT on day 1

The template ships with a deliberately small tool surface so Claude's decisions stay focused. Two things are worth adding **after** the project outgrows the defaults — but installing them too early just adds noise.

### 5.1 — `wshobson/agents` (when BMAD has a gap)

Add it when **all three** are true:

1. You've done at least one full BMAD cycle on the project.
2. You've identified a specific gap BMAD doesn't cover well (e.g. "I need a deep refactor specialist", "I need an SEO-focused content writer", "I need a SQL query optimizer").
3. You've checked that no built-in BMAD agent handles it.

Then:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
/plugin install <specific-plugin>
```

Install **one plugin at a time**. Claude's tool list gets noisy fast, and noise reduces decision quality.

### 5.2 — `CodeGraph` (when the project gets large)

[CodeGraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) is a local code-intelligence MCP. It pre-indexes your source into an AST knowledge graph (tree-sitter → local SQLite + FTS5), so Claude answers "where is X defined / what calls Y" by querying the index in a few calls instead of fanning out across grep / find / Read across dozens of files.

Add it when **all three** are true:

1. Your project has roughly **>1000 source files** — under that, plain grep is fast enough and the index is overhead.
2. You notice Claude burning many tool calls on code-navigation questions (not on writing new code, where Context7 already helps).
3. You're willing to keep one more local index running. CodeGraph re-syncs on file changes via native OS file watchers — usually invisible.

Reported median impact across real codebases (upstream benchmarks): **~59% fewer tokens, ~49% faster, ~70% fewer tool calls**. The headline 52→3 tool-call number in promo material is from a ~4000-file project — small projects see much smaller wins, which is why this is **not** installed by default.

Follow the install instructions at the upstream repo. It is MIT-licensed, runs 100% locally, needs no API key, and supports 19+ languages.

### Why these are NOT bundled

CodeGraph and `wshobson/agents` are valuable, but their value scales with project size or with specific gaps you've already felt. Installing them on an empty template means:

- More MCP tools / agents in Claude's tool list from day 1 → harder to pick the right tool, more tokens spent describing the surface.
- A maintenance surface (indexes, plugin updates) before there's anything to maintain.

The template's job is to **ship you to the starting line**. Add these the first time you feel the pain they solve.

## 6. Why SuperClaude is intentionally NOT installed

SuperClaude is a popular alternative framework that injects its own `CLAUDE.md` and instruction files into `~/.claude/`. Two problems with installing it on top of this template:

1. It would overwrite or compete with the carefully preserved Karpathy `CLAUDE.md`, which is the behavioral baseline this template is built around.
2. Its persona-switching model overlaps with BMAD's agent-handoff model — running both produces confused behavior.

Choose one or the other, not both. This template's choice is BMAD.

## 7. Multi-agent work — try Agent Teams first

When you need multiple Claude sessions to coordinate (parallel research, supervisor / worker patterns, durable state across sessions), reach for [**Claude Code Agent Teams**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) first. It is Anthropic's native primitive for the job — currently experimental, enabled via `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` in `~/.claude/settings.json`. No extra install, no extra framework, just a setting toggle.

For most projects at this template's scope you may not even need that — BMAD's `@agent` chain (PM → Architect → Dev → QA) already covers sequential multi-agent coordination, and the sequential version is usually enough.

Heavier orchestration frameworks (DAG control, durable workflow state at team / production scale) become worth their overhead later — when you cross that line, graduate to [`claude-code-industrial-workbench`](https://github.com/lordrance/claude-code-industrial-workbench).

## 8. Things this template will not solve for you

To be honest about scope:

- **Security review at scale** — for multi-person or regulated projects, use the heavyweight sibling [`claude-code-industrial-workbench`](https://github.com/lordrance/claude-code-industrial-workbench) instead. See [`./decision-bmad-vs-full-workbench.md`](./decision-bmad-vs-full-workbench.md).
- **Cost guardrails / token budgeting** — not implemented yet anywhere in the Claude Code ecosystem as of 2026-05. Watch your usage manually.
- **Eval harness / regression testing of AI behavior** — same as above.
- **Audit log of every AI action** — same as above.

These four are the Tier 3 gaps. They will land in a future revision of the heavyweight workbench, not here.

## 9. One-line summary

**This template ships you to the starting line; BMAD coaches you through the race; you finish projects faster than building from zero each time.**
